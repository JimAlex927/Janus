### Make server and transport budgets configurable

Commit message: `feat(config): make server and transport budgets configurable`

Scope:

- Added typed `Settings` configuration with defaults, duration-string parsing,
  and minimum/maximum validation for request, server, backend, capacity, SLO,
  and trust settings.
- Replaced hard-coded HTTP server and backend transport constants with values
  from validated settings. Existing configurations without a `settings` block
  continue to use the starter defaults.
- Separated inbound header and request-read budgets from the active overall
  request deadline. The overall deadline is attached to the request context and
  cancels backend work when it expires.
- Added a complete settings example in `configs/janus.json`.
- Added tests for settings defaults, duration parsing, validation boundaries,
  server and transport wiring, and backend cancellation.
- Updated the plan, protocol guide, and README to describe the new behavior.

Verification:

- `go test ./...`
- `go vet ./...`
- `go build -o bin/janus.exe ./cmd/janus`
- `go run ./cmd/janus -check -config configs/janus.json`

Scope note: `max_body_bytes` is now validated and documented, but request-body
size enforcement remains the next implementation task in `docs/plan.md`.
